//using const with array

const foods = ['milk']
foods.push('chocolate')
foods.unshift('tortillas')
foods.pop()
foods.pop()
foods.pop()
foods.push('lemon')
foods.push('kale')
foods.push('cheese')
foods.push('milk')

//easily change contents within array but due to const i can never change
//the actual array reference,only the contents inside.
